1. Reccomender system for Santander Products   [Project GitHub](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/santander-recommender-system)
   
   Skills: Recommender Systems (Collaborative Filtering), Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)
   
   The goal of this project is to create an effective recommendation system. This allows Santander bank to better meet the individual needs of all customers. To achieve this, the user- 
   item matrix will be used containing the ID of consumers and the products they owned as of May 28, 2015. Then, recommendations in three different recommendation models will be 
   calculated. It will be the popularity-based model, the memory-based collaborative filtering model, and the model-based collaborative filtering model. Then all three recommendations 
   models will be combined into the weighted hybrid recommendation system. The result will be evaluated using average precision metrics.

2. End-to-end Student Score Prediction   [Project GitHub](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/student-score-prediction)

   Skills: Docker, CI/CD, AWS, Data Cleaning (pandas), Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), Data Analysis (scikit-learn), optimization
   
   This project predicts the math score of a student given other relevant details such as gender, test preparation, education of school    
   lunch and other test scores. A thorough exploratory data analysis is carried out, and various models are experimented , such as random forest. The best model and parameters are selected. This application is used to track if a student is performing as expected 
   or if is need of intervention. Docker and AWS services are used to create a CI/CD pipeline.

3. [NLP Text Summarization using Huggingface](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/NLP-text-summarization)

   [Project GitHub](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/NLP-text-summarization)
   
   Huggingface's Pegasus model is implemented for a text summurization task. Additionally, an alternative text summurization method is 
   proposed that is more efficient. In the altenative method, the top percentage of sentence that has the highrest count of non-stop words 
   is selected. Stop words are words that contribute little help to the meaning of a sentence e.g. the, a, are.

4. [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/house-regression)

   [Project GitHub](https://github.com/ilora-ishaque/house-regression)

   A data set of house details with substantial data missing was preprocessed. The data was then used to fit a linear regression to predict 
   house prices.
